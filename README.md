# CrossBERT

e introduce a model created from a transformer-based machine learning technique called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, named CrossBERT.
We use the attention mechanism of this model to find cross-effects of different product categories.
These cross-effects are relevant for making informed marketing decisions that increase sales of a supermarket.
